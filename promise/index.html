      The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. 
      Its arguments resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JavaScript itself. 
      When the executor obtains the result, be it soon or late – doesn’t matter, it should call one of these callbacks:

        resolve(value) — if the job finished successfully, with result value.
        reject(error) — if an error occurred, error is the error object.
      
        finally always runs when the promise is settled: be it resolve or reject.

        finally is a good handler for performing cleanup, e.g. stopping our loading indicators, as they are not needed anymore, no matter what the outcome is
