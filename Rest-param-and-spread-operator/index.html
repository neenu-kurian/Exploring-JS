    Rest Parameters:
     A function can be called with any number of arguments, no matter how it is defined.There will be no error because of “excessive” arguments. But of course in the result only the first two will be counted.
     The rest of the parameters can be included in the function definition by using three dots ... followed by the name of the array that will contain them. The dots literally mean “gather the remaining parameters into an array”.
     The rest parameters must be at the end.

     Spread Operator:
     It looks similar to rest parameters, also using ..., but does quite the opposite.
     When ...arr is used in the function call, it “expands” an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.
