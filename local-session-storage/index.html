    The main features of localStorage are:

    Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
    The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.

    If you open the index.html in mutliple tabs or windows you get "test :1" in console.log as localStorage is shared between all tabs/windows of same origin.

    The sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab.
      Another tab with the same page will have a different storage.
      But it is shared between iframes in the same tab (assuming they come from the same origin).
      Survives page refresh (but not tab close)

     Advantage of Local and Session Storage over cookies:
        The data is saved locally only and canâ€™t be read by the server, which eliminates the security issue that cookies present.
        It allows for much more data to be saved (10Mb for most browsers).
