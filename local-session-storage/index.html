    The main features of localStorage are:

    Shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin.
    The data does not expire. It remains after the browser restart and even OS reboot.

    If you open the index.html in mutliple tabs or windows you get "alert(1)" as localStorage is shared between all tabs/windows of same origin.
